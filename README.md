# Description
How to estimate how many clients will not pay the money back? For this analysis, I used Pearson correlation because we can compare two independent variables to a dependent one. Python packages allow me to do so within few steps (see my code in wordx). 
The second project is on credit risk taken from a book on SAS but here we try to build a model-AI that could estimate risk. Please see my code and description in files named modeling.
